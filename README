This is my selected homework projects for the computer vision class I
took:

Please go to the course webpage to download test images for each
homework.

The precompiled libraries I included are only for WIN32 and directory
 listing functions are also dependent on <windows.h>, thus MSVC is 
needed for compling. 

Hw6 is a C++ implementation of Zhengyou Zhang's calibration method.

Hw8 is a C++ implementation of the AdaBoost object detection algorithm
with Haar features [1].
